domch.js
--------

domch.js is a Firefox DOM manipulation library.
domch.js can be used in GreaseMonkey scripts, in Firefox extensions, and in web pages.
It is still in an early stage (and might stay there).


The code is kind of a mess, it is not fit for production usage, I only wrote it for learning, and I use it mainly in greaseMonkey scripts.



very simple usage sample:

    $('a').css('border: 1px solid red;');
